# Housing Price Prediction Model with pytorch

Simple model built using pytorch, data cleaned and prepped using pandas, numpy. I will be using Selenium to
scrape for testing data to get a more expansive evaluation of the model.

The goal of this project is to create an accurate predictor of housing prices based solely on GPS coordinates.
I quickly expanded this idea, as coordinates alone was undermining the potential of the model. I also had to
switch datasets, as I realized too late that my original data was meant for approximating average house prices 
in general areas, rather than individual properties. Having switched, the model is performing much better. What
this process lacked in cleanliness, it made up for in learning experiences. It highlighted the importance of data
visualization and interpretation before starting a project, and secured a lot of fundamentals of how models should
be set up and tuned.
