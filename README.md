# Housing Price Prediction Model with pytorch

Simple model built using pytorch, data extracted and cleaned using pandas. The goal of this project is to
create an accurate predictor of housing prices based solely on GPS coordinates. I quickly expanded this 
idea, as coordinates alone was undermining the potential of the model. Currently implementing expansion
of the model to include coastal proximity, as I heard this was a good indicator for price.
